title: 'Understanding SOLID Principles in Android Developer Context'
---

This is my take on understanding the SOLID principle as a Android developer,so expect 

Uncle Bob's SOLID principles are a set of design principles that help you write better software in Object Oriented Programming paradime. They are a set of guidelines that help you write code that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. This is a one liner that you can expect from any Developer but to be honest i never 

Kotlin offers both Functional and OOPS paradigms which gives us the developers an edge on understanding this much faster:

- S : Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- O : Open Closed Principle
- L : Liskov Substitution Principle
- I : Interface Segregation Principle
- D : Dependency Inversion Principle


### SRP or Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one reason to change, here the reason is too abstract 


### Open Closed Principle

### Liskov Substitution Principle

### Interface Segregation Principle

### Dependency Inversion Principle

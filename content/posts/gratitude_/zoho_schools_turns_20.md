title: 'Zoho Schools turn 20'
---

Zoho Schools(ZS) Turns 20 and its an incredible milestone transforming millions of life. Hold on it sounds like some social charity thingy, but its not and they never advertised it to be one, The direly need a solution to hire employable people without burning too much cash for an associated company called "ZOHO" that was aiming to provide cloud solutions to small/large business. How did they solve this and also in-avertedly transform lives of millions in an unthinkable ways.

Why am i talking about this? well i am incomplete without talking about ZS... if my life is a line chart from -100 to 100 i was at -99 and now i am touching 75+ in my life's peak of ecstasy. When i heard about Zoho for the first time i had no place to call home barely supporting family in their old-age being with them physically, financially and emotionally because we all were in a complete mess as our life had hard-reset in literally in every way (I just went into an emotional black hole).

Sorry i went a little too deep i guess, so my life was at -99 on the number line,i was living in Banaras Streets and just living experiencing the voidness doing nothing, living on one meal a day, literally shivering all night during the cold winter because i knew i had no other option than to endure this experience... this went of for few months i got used to this voidness, finally guilt hit me because of abandoning my parents, what happened to them, are they alive or thoughts like these.

I connected with them on call and was happy to hear they alive and are managing well in a relatives house and are working to make the ends meet not just that the relatives are themselves are struggling to make ends meet so they want my parents to move out and since there is no other option they continuing there till they can do something...My mom was in contact with my mentors in a specific institute and they proposed her there something Eknath can try and i could transform all our life's to good.

What was that option? **Zoho Schools** - A MEANINGFUL ALTERNATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL COLLEGE EDUCATION yeah this is where i heard the term "Zoho" for the first time. After digging the internet is saw it could be promising and this is not scam and not an organization that is created to exploit people, since ive been to one that does i could figure out this one is not, so anyway it sounded really promising after hearing this i thought i will definitely try this instead of wasting my life doing nothing...

Now the delima was i am 1800km away form this city where ZS was planning for an exam, so i had no option to reach this place, can't ask parents and don't have a penny so my final option was to beg some money but  i guess i was too ashamed to do that i started writing them on paper asking to book a ticket for me to travel to chennai, i wrote almost 10-20 papers with this request and had it in my pocket, suddenly i got a message someone recharged my phone and in few minutes called me to say i must come to chennai ASAP if i intent to participate in the entrance exam, i could not tell him i had no money to travel, so i decided i will walk as far as i can at-least i would be less than 1800 km so i immediately started walking i can not use maps because i have limited battery. i reached the Varanasi Train station and walked opposite to the direction i landed few months back, i started walking in the night and as the sun hits i would take shelter this continued for few days and i was exhausted and could not walk anymore... i could not even ask help to anyone as i don't speak their language and i slept in that railway station and a grandma i still remember her face, she offered me hot sweet bun which was so tasty and refreshing and she took a train ticket for me to go to chennai, thanks to that grandma i have no idea what i would have done otherwise... she boarded me the train and gave the ticket and some cash she had.

i still had my phone i could not spend the money other than buying food because the journey is 3-4 if my memory is correct so i slowly heard i was reaching the city where my parents are i called them and told them i am hungry and need some bread and the train would reach in an hour.... that was the time my parents saw me after this long i did not say anything just took the bread and started eating it in hunger.

after 6 hrs i reached Chennai and called my contact and told him i reached chennai but i don't have any clean clothes to come and meet them, he came and took me to bigbazar and give me 2 shits a pant i think it was a red shirt, after wearing the new dress they took to meet someone at a coffee restaurant, the meeting was with the then evangalist of Zoho Mr. Rajendran Dandapani it was s short meeting where he was asking about what i have done and some small talks, then he asked me to join him to their office so they can see what can be done, traveling on the car i was asked "Do you believe in god" to be gone through some exuviating pain i told him "I don't think there is someone programming our life its basically its our conscious acts thats important" i am sure it sounded atheist or maybe he had something else popped up he asked me get down of the car and come on Train to the location. i have never been to this place so i called the friend and inquired the route to reach the office, somehow i reached the office and he introduced me to two people they took me to the then woodlands on cycle on a dirt road, finally met Raj San and he shared the details about the exam as how...

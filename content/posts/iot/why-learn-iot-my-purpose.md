## Intro

As a growing software developer, I’ve always enjoyed building things in the digital world. But lately, I’ve felt a pull towards more — towards creating things that bridge the gap between software and the physical world.

That’s where IoT (Internet of Things) comes in. My curiosity was sparked thanks to a good friend who works in this field. We often find ourselves deep in conversation during our daily walks. One chat that truly stayed with me was about crystals and their role on a chip to keep track of time. It was mesmerizing. (Here’s a video that explains it beautifully: [Link])

At the same time, my manager has been sharing exciting updates about AI advances and often speaks about how the future belongs to fields like IoT and AI working together. That has been another powerful motivator — encouraging me to explore how software, hardware, and intelligence can come together to build the next generation of solutions.

So here I am — excited to start this journey of learning IoT, blending code with reality, and turning ideas into connected, smart things.

## Basics

As someone coming from a software background, IoT (Internet of Things) feels like a bridge between the digital world I know and the physical world I want to explore. This post is my attempt to break down the basics of IoT in a simple, beginner-friendly way — as I start my own journey into this fascinating field.

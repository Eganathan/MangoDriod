Terminal is lit already but these are some must have commandline tools that i use and i think you must have too.

## HomeBrew

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS (and Linux) that lets you easily install, update, and manage software and developer tools from the command line.

```bash
# Installation command
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After running the above command, just restart the terminal and you are good to go, before we start installing stuff lets understand what is formula and cask in brew context.

**Formula:**  They are Command-line tools, libraries, languages (Kotlin, Go etc) this does not need any decorators while handling any brew operations. [AllFormulas](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/)

**Cask:** Casks are UI applications like chrome, vscode etc and need a `--cask decorator` for operations with it.[CaskDirectory](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/)

```bash
brew install git             # installing  formula example
brew install --cask firefox  # installing cask example

brew uninstall foo           # remove it
brew upgrade foo             # upgrade it
brew list                    # see installed packages
brew search foo              # find packages
brew info foo                # details about a package
brew update                  # update Homebrew itself
brew upgrade                 # upgrade everything
```

## Ollama - Local and OpenSource LLMs

This is an incredibly useful tool ‚Äî I find myself using it almost every other hour.
Local models are fantastic for answering generic or timeless questions where accuracy matters and you don‚Äôt need up-to-the-minute data. They‚Äôre fast, private, work offline, and come with another big advantage: üå± reduced environmental impact.

**Instructions:**

1. Click on the [Download](https://ollama.com/download) and download the software via the website.
2. navigate to the downloaded folder and unzip the file, just like this `unzip Ollama-darwin.zip`.
3. Now `ls` and you will see a new file called `Ollama.app`.
4. run the open command `open Ollama.app` and agree and allow everything it asks(don't worry its safe).
5. Browse a model form the [ModelLIbrary](https://ollama.com/search), keep an eye on the size some models are like 500 GB ü´¢
6. Once you have picked you model then run `ollama run model_name` ie `ollama run deepseek-r1`
7. After the download is complete you can serve it `ollama serve deepseek-r1`.
8. You can interact with the model now, to exit just type `/bye` and you are out.

That was a long process i know, but now anytime you have a question you can just run `ollama run deepseek-r1` and you can interact without any hassle.

| Command                          | Description |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| `ollama serve`                   | Starts Ollama on your local system. |
| `ollama create <new_model>`       | Creates a new model from an existing one for customization or training. |
| `ollama show <model>`             | Displays details about a specific model, such as its configuration and release date. |
| `ollama run <model>`              | Runs the specified model, making it ready for interaction. |
| `ollama pull <model>`             | Downloads the specified model to your system. |
| `ollama list`                     | Lists all the downloaded models. |

| `ollama stop <model>`             | Stops the specified running model. |

## DuckDuckGo

Search engine is not going away, some times you need to verify things quickly so here comes the DuckDuckGo search engine in cli, you just run `ddgr whats the latest news about ai` and you get a list faster than a bullet(Most of the time).

```bash
# Installation
brew install ddgr
```

### Common Commands

These are the commands you will mostly need

| Command                          | Description |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| `ddgr <query>`                   | Perform a search using DuckDuckGo. |
| `ddgr -n <number> <query>`        | Limit the number of search results. |
| `ddgr -j <query>`                 | Search and open the first result automatically in the browser. |
| `ddgr -w <site> <query>`          | Restrict the search to a specific site (site:). |
| `ddgr -s <region> <query>`        | Set region for search (e.g., `-s us-en`). |
| `ddgr -x <query>`                 | Search without opening a browser (display URLs only). |
| `ddgr -C <query>`                 | Colorize the output for easier reading. |

### navigation Commands

When the results are displayed interactively you can use this to navigate
| Shortcut / Action | What it does |
|------------------|--------------|
| `[number]`        | Open the result with that number in your browser. |
| `n` or `N`        | Show the next page of results. |
| `p` or `P`        | Show the previous page of results. |
| `o [number]`      | Open multiple results by space-separated numbers, e.g. `o 1 3 5`. |

There is so much you can do which you can explore but here is one that i use extensively:

```bash
ddgr -n 5 -w github.com "awesome shell scripts"
# Shows 5 results from GitHub for your query.
```

### Profile Configuration

You can also configure the behavior my modifying the `.ddgrrc` file, you can update it via terminal by running the `vi ~/.ddgrrc` command, here are the options you can configure:

| Option                  | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `-n <number>`            | Set the number of search results per page. |
| `-C`                     | Enable colorized output for better readability. |

## Git CLI

```bash
brew install git
```

Im sure you know the git commands so im skipping them, but the profile configuration is really cool so instead of `git status` you can just run `gs` command and here is how.

1. find where your system wide git profile is stored by running `git config --list --show-origin`
2. open that file in vim and and your aliases and other profiles and save for re-open the terminal.

Here is an example file at `~/.gitconfig`

```ini
[credential]
        helper = store
[user]
        name = Eganathan R
        email = md-email@gmail.com
[filter "lfs"]
        smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
        process = git-lfs filter-process
        required = true
        clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
[init]
        defaultBranch = master
[http]
        proxy = http://127.1.1.2:xxxx
[alias]
        st = status
        co = checkout
        br = branch
        ci = commit
        lg = log --oneline --graph --decorate
```

I am certain this helps you, There are many such commandline tools that are really intreating but i think of them as a decorators so i have not added them but check out starship, podman cli, tmux and many others.

Thanks for reading and have a great day ‚ò∫Ô∏è

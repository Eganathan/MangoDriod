title: 'Exploring Solid Principles With kotlin'
---

Uncle Bob's SOLID principles are a set of design principles that help you write better software in Object Oriented Programming paradagime. They are a set of guidelines that help you write code that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. This is a one liner that you can expect from any Developer but we are going to dig a little deeper into each principles one by one. 

Kotlin offers both Functional and OOPS paradagimes which gives us the developers an edge on understanding this much faster:

- S : Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- O : Open Closed Principle
- L : Liskov Substitution Principle
- I : Interface Segregation Principle
- D : Dependency Inversion Principle

### SRP or Sinlge Responsibility Principle

### Open Closed Principle

### Liskov Substitution Principle

### Interface Segregation Principle

### Dependency Inversion Principle

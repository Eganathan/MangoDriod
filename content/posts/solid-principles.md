Uncle Bob's SOLID principles are a set of design principles that help you write better software. They are a set of guidelines that help you write code that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. This is a one word answer that you can expect from any Developer but we are going to ding a little deeper into each principles one by one.

- S : Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- O : Open Closed Principle
- L : Liskov Substitution Principle
- I : Interface Segregation Principle
- D : Dependency Inversion Principle

## SRP or Sinlge Responsibility Principle
## Open Closed Principle
## Liskov Substitution Principle
## Interface Segregation Principle
## Dependency Inversion Principle

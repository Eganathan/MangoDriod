Previously we discussed about the strategies and picked Google's Room Library,now lets get started with setting up the library and a deeper look into the dependencies.

## Setup

Since Google has the best article for setting up, I will be skipping the setup up
Dependency setup: [Official Guide on Setting up Room Dependencies and plugins](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room)

Please do ensure you follow the above guide and then sync and build your project successfully, as it will help you to try out the components yourself. In this article, my intention is to explore the key components of Room, a bare minimum you need to know to implement a simple offline-first app. For a detailed and more complex use case, check out my upcoming article.

In our [previous article](https://md.eknath.dev/posts/upgrading-your-app-to-offline-first-with-room-part-4/), we covered **Entities** in Room. Now, let‚Äôs explore **DAOs (Data Access Objects)** ‚Äì the bridge between your app and the database. DAOs allow you to execute queries that allow is to insert, update, and delete records efficiently.

## What is a DAO?

A DAO is an interface annotated with @Dao that defines methods for interacting with the database. The Room compiler generates the necessary implementation for these methods, making database access efficient and type-safe. A typical DAO will look something like this:

```kotlin
@Dao
interface ProductDao {

    @Query("SELECT * FROM products")
    suspend fun getAllProducts(): List<Product>

    @Query("SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = :productId")
    suspend fun getProductById(productId: Long): Product?

    @Insert
    suspend fun insertProduct(product: Product)

    @Insert
    suspend fun insertProducts(products: List<Product>)
    
    @Update
    suspend fun updateProduct(product: Product)

    @Delete
    suspend fun deleteProduct(product: Product)

    @Upsert
    suspend fun upsertProduct(product: Product)
}
```

Similar pattern can be found in most simple CRUD app's, while this is created by the developer the instance of the Dao's are created when the Database is build and the generated implementation file will be stored at `app/build/generated/source/kapt/debug/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME/database/ProductDao_Impl.java` if you are used `kapt` and the generated class will have an implementation for each query the developer has provided.

The **select query** annotated with `@Query` on the above **DAO** will look like the code below, **if you are to use SQLLite Directly this is the code you would have to write manually for each query and DAOs**:

```java
@Override
public Object getAllProducts(Continuation<? super List<Product>> continuation) {
    final String _sql = "SELECT * FROM products";
    final RoomSQLiteQuery _statement = RoomSQLiteQuery.acquire(_sql, 0);
    return CoroutinesRoom.execute(__db, false, continuation, new Callable<List<Product>>() {
        @Override
        public List<Product> call() throws Exception {
            Cursor _cursor = DBUtil.query(__db, _statement, false, null);
            try {
                List<Product> _result = new ArrayList<>();
                while (_cursor.moveToNext()) {
                    Product _item = new Product();
                    _item.id = _cursor.getLong(_cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow("id"));
                    _item.name = _cursor.getString(_cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow("name"));
                    _item.price = _cursor.getFloat(_cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow("price"));
                    _result.add(_item);
                }
                return _result;
            } finally {
                _cursor.close();
                _statement.release();
            }
        }
    });
}
```
Is't it so nice how **instead of writing 24 lines we just have to write 1**, üôè Thank You, Android and Google Team for making this extremely robust and performant. Now that we know about **Dao** and what happens behind the scenes, lets go through the supported annotations.

## Supported Annotations

On the previous section of DAO you might have noticed the annotations on each query, these help the compiler to generate query objects on your behalf, lets go through each supported annotation to understand when to use them.

### @Insert

Used for **inserting single or multiple entires to a table**, this will **skip validation of checking if a duplicate entry with same primary id exists**, so its faster for insertion when you are absolutely are clear that duplicate entries are impossible. In case **if you inset a duplicate entry the app will crash** with exception primary key already exists.

Here is an example of how the `@Insert` can be used:

```kotlin
...
    //Inserting single item
    @Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE)
    suspend fun insertProduct(product: Product)     

    //Inserting multiple items
    @Insert
    suspend fun insertProducts(products: List<Product>)     
...
```

#### Conflict Strategy

Defining the conflict strategy on the query tells room how to handle the conflict effectively by default its `NONE`:

- `NONE` : Default strategy when you insert duplicate it crashes the app.
- `REPLACE` : Keep the old data and ignore the new data.
- `ABORT` : Aborts the transaction entirely so none of the entries will be updated.
- `IGNORE`: Skip the entry and proceed to next

You can set your preference as per your requirement, but if you want the behavior of `REPLACE` hold on there is another annotation that we will learn about soon that is a better option.

‚ö†Ô∏è Beware: inserting duplicate entries will crash the app, if you don't provide a conflict strategy.

### @Update

Used for updating all columns of an existing row where the primary key matches, If the table does not contain a matching primary key, the update fails silently (no error or no exception) but the unmatched entries remain unchanged (they are not inserted or modified).

Like the `@insert` you can `@update` single or multiple entries, a sample code will look something like this:

```kotlin
...
    //Updating single item
    @Update
    suspend fun updateProduct(product: Product)     

    //Updating multiple items
    @Update
    suspend fun updateProducts(products: List<Product>)     
...
```

Update basically overrides the provided value to matched entries so if you accidentally provide null value, that is exactly what the matched row's column will be, for example if you want to mark the product as sold-out you will might think you have to send only a product object with `id` and the `isSold` value but if you do that all other values like name, date and other values will be set as null so ensure you provide all values.


‚ö†Ô∏è You are basically overriding all values, so ensure you provide all values in each entry.
‚ö†Ô∏è Unmatched rows will not be inserted, no errors or exceptions will be thrown

### @Upsert

`@Upsert` is a combination of `@Insert` and `@Update`, if the entry matches the **primary-key** it updates them,otherwise it inserts them smoothly, you could use `@Insert` with `REPLACE` if your table has no primary key otherwise this is better.

This is an example of how the ``@Upsert` will be used in a dao

```kotlin
// upsert single item
@Upsert
suspend fun upsertProduct(product: Product)


// upsert bulk Item
@Upsert
suspend fun upsertProducts(products: List<Product>)
```

One thing to note is that the conflict is handled only for the primary key, if your table has other columns that are set as unique the upsert may still fail if that rule is ever broken due to new data.

‚ö†Ô∏è Requires the primary key
‚ö†Ô∏è If your table has unique constraints on other columns, @Upsert may still fail.

### @Delete

Enables you to delete single and multiple entities blissfully, if the row does not exists it fails silently which means that the entries that exist will be delete and the other will not since it does not exit, here is how a typical delete functions will look like:

```kotlin
// delete single item
@Delete
suspend fun deleteProduct(product: Product)


// delete bulk Item
@Delete
suspend fun deleteProducts(products: List<Product>)
```

I don't like to pass the entire entity for deletions so i prefer to use `@Query` for it so i can just pass the primary keys for deletion, but for simplicity you can use the `@Delete` as well.

### @Query

The `@Query` swiss knife that allows you to write custom SQL queries to interact with your database. It provides more flexibility than other annotations (`@Insert`, `@Update`, `@Delete`) and is essential for performing simple/complex operations depending on our use-cases.

```kotlin
...
// bulk get
@Query("SELECT * FROM products")
suspend fun getAllProducts(): List<Product>

// single get 
@Query("SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = :productId")
suspend fun getProductById(productId: Long): Product?

// search Query
@Query("SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%' || :searchQuery || '%'")
suspend fun searchProducts(searchQuery: String): List<Product>

// deleting item with ID
@Query("DELETE FROM products WHERE id = :productId")
suspend fun deleteProductById(productId: Long)

// delete multiple items
@Query("DELETE FROM products WHERE id IN (:productIds)")
suspend fun deleteProductById(productIds: List<Long>)

// deleting all entries (truncates)
@Query("DELETE FROM products")
suspend fun deleteAllProducts()
...
```

Swiss Knife it is, you can do all kind of operations with it, its gives us more flexibility but as we know "With Great Power comes Great Responsibility". Although `@Query` is powerful, it can fail in various ways due to syntax errors, missing data, type mismatches, or database constraints etc.. so use it cautiously and expect exceptions and app crashes.
### @RawQuery

The `@RawQuery` annotation in Room allows you to write and execute fully dynamic SQL queries, will will explore about this later in this series its breaks the simplicity boundary because there is no compile-time safety on this.

## üöÄ Conclusion

Room Entities form the foundation of Android's database layer, allowing structured and efficient data management. By following best practices, you ensure scalable and maintainable database architectures.
